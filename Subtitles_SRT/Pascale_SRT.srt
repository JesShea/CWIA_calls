00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,840
Hi Pascale thanks for being with us today so we can get to know a little bit more about your role and what you do within CAE. 

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,560
So to start could you tell us a little bit about your position?

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,640
Pascale: Hi thank you, thank you for having me! I'm the Director of Public Affairs and Global Communications at CAE.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Basically CAE is a global company we train pilots as well as you know other crew members in aviation and

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:44,800
What I do is - I'm responsible for the reputation of the company externally.

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,760
So it could be you know through, the media or in general the public or internally with employees.

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:00,680
Big part of what we do in a communications team is engage employees, so that's also part of our role.

8
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:08,520
You know, how you make people within the company feel you know, proud and and externally to increase the visibility of the company

9
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:18,000
so that people see CAE as a company that they would like to work for or that, you know,


10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,320
that they would admire. So you know, basically that's the role of Communications.

11
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,000
Also protect protect the company from, you know any issues, crisis, etc by you know,

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,960
preparing the messages or doing the strategies that will you know protect.

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,720
So basically it's protection and promotion in a way of the company.

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,120
Iris: I come from a Comms background as well so I fully appreciate that you know,

15
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,080
reputation management is such a big part of that job. Now, you've been with CAE for 20 years which is such a success story in and of itself,

16
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,160
but there also come some challenges in being within an organization for that long.

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,320
How do you stay passionate and engaged in the work that you do you after after 20 years?

18
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,200
Pascale: One thing that drives me is seeing the company grow and the fact that you're participating in that growth.

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,280
Also the fact that I get to speak to people who are around the world every day!

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:28,480
So my colleagues, I could be speaking to colleagues who are in Korea or in the Philippines, the UK, Australia...

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,560
So it's incredible. And it's even, you know what? With this this pandemic,

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,960
it's even brought us even closer together because we do all these these calls, you know

23
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,680
with people from around the world all the time and it's fabulous.

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:52,840
So this "global-ness" is really exciting. But from a personal perspective,

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:02,520
I love being part of a team where I can coach my colleagues, coach people in the communications team to grow 

26
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,240
To empower them. To see the results. 

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:17,240
They do things even better than I would in the end so you know, these are all things that bring
you know, feed me in my job.

28
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Iris: I love  the idea of the mentorship aspect of it all because it is so much of what you do,

29
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,840
the further up you get into a company is imparting your wisdom and knowledge and making sure that the 

30
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,040
next generation moving up is going to be I guess, better than you were at that stage,

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,200
because they have you mentoring them. That's great.

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,920
What would you say is the coolest thing you've gotten to do you in your current position?

33
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:55,720
Pascale: Let me put it in two ways-
We work with really cool technology. So I remember one day when the A380 simulator was ready and I went there 


34
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:05,040
and we were filming something for you know for communications and I got a chance to be in the cockpit 

35
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,440
and actually land the A380 simulator! That was really exciting, I remember that.

36
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,480
Like, you know I'm basically landing this huge plane.


37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,360
So but apart from that- apart from the cool technology,I would say

38
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:30,200
the the coolest project is a long term project and it's basically helping you know "evolve" the culture of our company.

39
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,120
So there was a time a few years ago where engagement in the company was really low 

40
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,840
and in terms of the communications team and the HR team, and you know we all got together

41
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:51,400
and it's a long process but we started you know trying to see how we can get engagement up in the company.

42
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,640
For instance, around the 70th anniversary of our company, we did like a whole year of celebrations.

43
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,560
A whole year of recognizing people for what they did.

44
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,040
A whole year of giving back to our people, giving back to our our employees.

45
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:17,840
And we saw like a huge change in engagement, and we saw how we had an impact on our people

46
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:27,880
and how you know people became more engaged in the company and the work became easier for everybody. 

47
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:36,560
So basically, I was proud of that- proud of the impact that we could have you know with with what I do.

48
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
Iris: It is nice to see sort of the evolution and you know when you're working for a big company,

49
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,720
it is sometimes hard to see yourself as a change maker and everything. 

50
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,520
But to have that ownership, of the program and to positively influence internally engagement and culture is such a huge thing.

51
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,640
Congratulations on that!

52
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,360
Now if you could ask your role model in the industry anything, what would it be?

53
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,640
Pascale: I don't have a specific role model in the industry.

54
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm not sure if we're talking about the industry in terms of aviation or industry in terms of communication,


55
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,400
but I would say, that one thing that I would ask, for instance people that I admire-

56
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,560
who have a lot of charisma, you know Obama or Gandhi or anyone like that is 

57
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:35,360
"How do you make people feel important and and make them feel better?"

58
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,200
So for instance, these are leaders who speak to huge crowds. 
 They touch the whole world. 

59
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:48,960
But when you listen to them, it's as if they're talking to you specifically and that's what I find you know,

60
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:58,080
this it's very inspiring and I, you know, I would love to know, what can we do to have an impact like that? 

61
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,080
To touch people in that way.

62
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,760
Iris: I think that's a goal for so many people is how to, you know-

63
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,520
how to reach many but also at the same time reach the single person because that's where the change comes from.

64
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,280
So much, it's one person holding onto your words, holding onto your inspiration and moving 

65
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,080
It forward internally and pushing it that way so that's great.

66
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,240
Pascale, thank you so much for joining us today it was great to hear more about your role and the 

67
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,280
impact you're having on CAE and I fully appreciate your international experience because 

68
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,880
that's how you and I got to meet, thank you very much for joining us today and have a have a great day 
:)

69
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,840
Pascale: Thank you so much Iris for having me, it was really nice to see you again first of all,

70
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,600
it's true it's been I think you know maybe 10 years?

71
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you for this great initiative of having these interviews. 
:)
