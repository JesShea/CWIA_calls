1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,240
Hi Beth, thanks for being with us today we can get to know 

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,040
a little bit more about you. So to start off,

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,120
could you talk a little bit about your move into aviation?

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,120
What compelled you to explore career opportunities within the industry?

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,120
Beth: Hi Iris, hanks for having me!

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,120
So in retrospect it looks like this was a deliberate plan,

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,200
but it really wasn't. I started my career in engineering and high tech.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,200
I knew that I was never going to be an electron guru,

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
but I really liked the business side. I went and did my 

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,280
MBA in the Netherlands and then moved to the U. K. 

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,200
and joined a management consulting firm there. 

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,200
I worked in predominately, sort of heavy industries, like I  

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,200
had contracts in the North of Scotland and England working

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,200
on railway maintenance, and in paint factories 

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,200
in France, Germany and the Netherlands and all of that gave me an appreciation for

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,040
the operational side and the efficiency side of business. 

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,040
At the same time, I had that the opportunity to travel for work,

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,040
but also for leisure, around Europe, Africa and Asia. 

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,040
When I moved back to Canada, I joined Aeroplan which started 

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,040
as a six week strategy project and grew into-

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,040
I've now been a part of that organization now for over 11 years.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,720
And really I had a number of interesting roles, all underpinned by-

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,400
you know an application of math and data to business performance.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Also I particularly liked being able you know,

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,400
now inside of Aviation, being able to relate to our customers.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,400
You know, working in management consulting I, you know,

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
I worked in a conveyor belt factory- so I really couldn't 

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,400
relate to the product. Where as, in aviation, you know travel

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,360
and my interest in travel, I can directly relate to what we're trying to do.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,200
We fast forward to a few years ago when Air Canada acquired Aeroplan,

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,200
I was asked to lead the integration of Aeroplane into 

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,160
Air Canada, and I knew at the moment I started to meet 

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,160
the people inside the airline and get an appreciation for 

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,760
the leadership and how the airline was run, I saw this as

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,520
a great opportunity to be able to apply what I've been learning elsewhere

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,520
and apply and then learn a whole new industry.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,520
And so as I said, I didn't start, it looks in retrospect 

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,520
like there was a deliberate plan but now, you know,

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,800
now it all makes sense and you know I'm I'm thrilled to be part of it.

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,520
Iris: Who would you say outside of your family has had the biggest impact on your life, and how?

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Beth: Well, I'm an avid observer of people.

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,480
Some call it curious or nosy, I prefer to think of it

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,760
As an "observer". So I take inspiration from everywhere.

44
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,160
So I like to think that there are lots of people who have had

45
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,560
an impact on me. You know, I've been very fortunate to have had an influential,

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,040
very influential swim coach growing up in high school.

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I've had a number of really good bosses who, you know,

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,040
their appreciation of my strengths and the belief in me,

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,880
has had impact, direct impact, in the role I was in, but almost more 

50
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,040
in retrospect I draw upon the conversations that we had and 

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,040
the belief they had me in my subsequent roles.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Iris: What are some of the key lessons that you learned in your 

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
previous roles that helped you prepare for your work in aviation?

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,920
Beth: Aviation is renowned for its complexity 

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,280
and for all of the different lingo and and sort of "inter-connectedness" 

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,440
of the industry, and I think you know, I draw upon 

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,400
good management consultants, listen to their clients, they're not experts themselves, and the role of 

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,440
management consulting is often  sort of listening to,

59
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,440
and piece together what everyone's telling you  

60
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,440
in order to be able to formulate a plan, apply some structure

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,280
and help adhere to that plan, deliver the plan.

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,440
I feel like, you know me having that as my background, it's been 

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,440
really helpful you know I'm often sitting and listening and 

64
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,440
trying to piece together all of the different elements in order to 

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,000
be able to learn and build my business accumen in the airline industry.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,600
Iris: What would you say are three things that are crucial to creating your own success?

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Beth: I think for me it's about having a plan it doesn't need to be,

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,520
you know, a "micro-plan" but more having a general plan,

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,760
and then having the confidence to rely on that plan.

70
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,600
And then I think the third probably is to seize opportunities you know 

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,600
this isn't about... I can picture in my head you know,

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
times when I was patient and then sort of saw an opportunity and then 

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
was able to seize my way into either evolving you know,

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,760
shaping a different project or taking on a different role,

75
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,600
but it's not being afraid of sort of identifying those opportunities, and then seizing them.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Iris: Ok, so now it's time for our fast answers round-

77
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm gonna ask you a few questions and if you could just say

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,960
the first thing that comes to your mind- we'll get through this!

79
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Best aviation moment you've had?

80
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Beth: I think probably the best was one of the first and then at

81
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,960
the time I didn't even know it. 

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Air Canada celebrated her 75th anniversary a while ago and I was

83
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
invited to participate in that- not as Air Canada but as part of Aeroplan.

84
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,960
At the time they were unveiling their new Dreamliner, and I think

85
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,960
going into it I had no expectations. Then you know, I remember coming

86
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,960
away from it saying "That was really cool!" like I didn't know

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,960
I was interested in airplanes and then going on that Dreamliner and

88
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,960
sort of seeing what it was like... and then also, sort of 

89
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,960
seeing all of the culture and tradition and the evolution of the airline.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I love that! I eat that stuff up! 

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
So I think those two things together where the starting point for

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,960
you know where I now, thankfully ended up inside aviation.

93
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Iris: What is a difficult challenge you've overcome?

94
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Beth: I've been very fortunate throughout my career to have been supported

95
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,960
all the way through but it has been an industry- 

96
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,440
or has been a path that- there aren't as many females.

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,960
You know, through engineering and management consulting, and even now. 

98
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,960
I think some of the challenges, interestingly, have been you know

99
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,960
kind of challenging my own beliefs. I remember there was a project,

100
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,960
like a super difficult project we had, and there were three females

101
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,600
on the project. We were young females, going and trying to change,

102
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,960
you know a very steadfast industry who were held in their beliefs...

103
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,960
and I remember, you know I remember kind of questioning myself.

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Can we even do this?

105
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,960
And my bosses never wavered, didn't even consider, you know,

106
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,560
not bringing in a male to help it because they believed so strongly

107
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,560
in that we could do it, and we did!

108
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,560
So I think I use that as right, now when things are hard I'm like 

109
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
"Well if I did that, I can do anything!"

110
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
you know, or this doesn't seem that hard vs. how that went

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Iris: "What do you think is a strength of yours that's help in your career?

112
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Beth: I think being able to learn quickly and the kind of assimilate 

113
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,560
and connect dots quickly, I think has helped me along the way.

114
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,560
You know, I'm not an expert in anything and so you know,

115
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,560
being able to understand well enough and connect it to something else 

116
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I think has helped me. 

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,560
I also think, I'm an introvert so I and I'm very aware of 

118
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,720
how I get my energy is about you know being able to figure stuff out myself

119
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
and being in my head, working usually with sort of data or structure

120
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
and figuring stuff out and I think, that too has helped me of 

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800
being able to apply that pull myself away figure something out and then

122
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,240
kind of come back to it and being able to apply that in a way that adds value

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,520
Have been strengths that have helped me along the way.

124
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Iris: What is something new that you've learned in the past year?

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Beth: For me, I think, as I said, the Airline industry is a complex one,

126
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,040
and so it's been nothing but learning over the last year, and I loved it! 

127
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,000
It's everything from how the different pieces fit together and the

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
sort of interplay between the different teams and departments to the airline lingo

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,200
to being able to sort of connect what different views of our data 

130
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
and of our performance and how do those pieces connect together. 

131
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,640
So I feel like a year and a half into the airline industry, I've been on this

132
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,640
super steep learning curve and I've loved it!

133
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Iris: What is one piece of advice you would give your younger self?

134
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Beth: Believe and trust your gut. So believe in what you think.

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,640
You know, rely on your gut. Be it a good thing or a bad thing, and 

136
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,640
so you know if it feels right- go for it, if it doesn't feel right-

137
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
just you know, cut it loose right then and there

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,640
and I think, you know that's something that I've built over time 

139
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,640
with having the confidence to believe in my gut and I think you know,

140
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,840
I sort of wish I knew that before, it wouldn't have meant I 

141
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,640
probably would have made different decisions differently but, I probably would go after them quicker had I had that confidence.

142
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,480
Iris: And then the last question, what is one thing you want to achieve in

143
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,480
the next twelve months?

144
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Beth: I would love you know, to be able to contribute to the recovery of

145
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,720
the airline. This has been a crazy last six months and I'd like to be able

146
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,160
to use this crisis as an opportunity for us to come back even better-

147
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,000
more data driven, more customer centric, and stronger.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,720
As a team, as a company, as an industry over the next twelve months.

149
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Iris: That's great!
