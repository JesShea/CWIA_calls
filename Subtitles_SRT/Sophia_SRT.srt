1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,200
Hi Sophia. Thanks so much for joining us today.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Can you tell us a little bit about how you got into the field of Aviation?

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Sophia :Hi Nisha it's lovely to be here, thanks for having me!

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,160
I'm from a small town in southern Alberta called Crowsnest Pass and we had a gentleman that moved into my little neighborhood and

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,160
he just was like the kind of person  that I would say "oozed cool" and he actually said "Sophia, you should join Air Cadets!"

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,160
and I was like "Nooooo..." You know, I get picked on and I was chubby and just like not in a good spot in my headspace.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Later on   we found out he's a fighter pilot with the Canadian Forces. So no wonder he "oozed cool" right? He was one of those people.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,160
One of those "Amazing, look what you've done!" kind of people. But he kept encouraging me,

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,120
So finally, I just did it so he would stop bugging you need me

10
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,120
I joined, and I didn't like it at first at  all, I had to go put my hair

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,120
up in a bun, ironically. I had to polish boots, I had to learn how to iron

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,120
I was like "Oh this is no fun, this is too hard!". My parents actually taught me such a huge lesson then that I'll never forget:

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,120
"No no no, you signed up for this. Give it an honest try, give it a year. If you still don't like it after a year, fine you can quit"

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,120
I grumbled and whatever else and I started actually liking it. I'm loud, so I started getting good at drills and the marching side of it and the commands of it.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,120
And I started making friends and just feeling like I found my community and my place.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Close to the end of that year, this pilot, his call sign was "Midas"

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,120
He brought an F-18 down to Lethbridge - I fell in love with that thing!

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,120
Like it was just this big cool airplane and I was terrified of him and everything, still being very insecure at that age.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,120
but you know, walked around and get  to touch it and talk about it and all the stuff at the end of the day,

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,120
He went to leave and he took off and let us all stand on the apron and I remember like hands on the ears because it was so loud.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,120
and I just felt my whole body go "Oh my god, this is cool!"

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,120
It was like I fell in love and someone hit me over the head and said "Airplanes, you gotta do that!"

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Nisha: So what are some of the opportunities you've found through Aviation?

24
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Sophia: The people,  that's my favorite part!

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Including yourself and everyone at CWIA. People are generally really excited and happy 

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,120
There's opportunity to go wherever you want to go with it. 

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I've got to go all over the place as a pilot.

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,120
I've got to go to different conferences as a female pilot and really explore that..

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Speaking engagements and just learning different things such as you know,

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,120
being on boards and what not as well so, it's endless really!

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Nisha: You need to say it again for people in the back because that's another thing that I really love about being part of this industry as well!

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,120
What is the best piece of advice that you received?

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,120
I'm in the master class with Elevate Aviation right now - different speakers from Kathy Fox with the TSB,

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,120
and Nicole Girard with Transport Canada, so many amazing people that give you different advice

35
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,120
it's really hard to go through it all and find out what matters to you at a certain point in your life. 

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,120
The best advice I ever was given and that is sort of my motto to this day is to aim high and never give up.

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,120
I just I try to live by that in general. There's no such thing as dreaming too big, it just might take you longer

38
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Nisha: What are three things you would say are crucial to creating success? 

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Sophia: Part of it is as believing in yourself and knowing that it's okay when you don't.

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
I've had lots of conversations with other women in aviation and that's

41
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,120
always a question of "Well I don't have everything on this box ticked off so I can't apply for that job"

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,120
or "Well, I'm okay, but I'm not great". 

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
You know, it's all our own self criticisms that will sometimes hold us back.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,120
"OK I can do this, oooh god I'm scared... But I'm still gonna try! ". That push forward-

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,120
So I guess, I don't know if you would call that tenacity, but that was a big part of it.

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,120
As well as just being able to be honest with yourself about what your failures are 

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I've definitely failed A LOT and that's okay.

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
You learn from each of those and you try to get better. 

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,120
In Aviation, that's  pushed constantly, safety is number one across the board

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,120
every time anybody in this whole industry has failed, we've analyzed the heck out of it 

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,120
and tried to go "Ok, so how do we make it better?"

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,120
How do we grow?

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,120
How do I make it safer for everyone else?" I love that now, but

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,120
it took a while to get used to because it's like 

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,120
"Oh god I did something wrong, don't look at me!"

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,120
But look at me, let's learn, let's grow, let's figure it out!

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,120
The other one is ever bring a bridge

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,120
It's a very small industry.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,120
I remember when I was in Aviation College, there was somebody that,

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,120
just didn't click right now.

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
I thought "I really don't like this person." And then I was like "This is mean, I'm being mean, stop it!" and he was kind

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,120
of mean and I kept hearing "Don't burn a bridge Sophia, don't burn a bridge"

63
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,120
like later we became friends and I'm so grateful for it,  it's echoed  throughout my whole career

64
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
 you know being kind to people trying to find ways to 

65
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,120
even if you're not going to be best friends.

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,120
even if you're not going to be best friends.

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,120
That's okay, but don't burn a bridge.

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,120
Nisha: The gravity that your insecurity has; especially as a young woman I find that you have to work 

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
so hard to overcome that. The last thing you said about Burning Bridges, man I can tell

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
you I feel that right now some days. That's phenomenal advice

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,120
to kind of take that long-term perspective on things.

72
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,120
What is your best Aviation moment?

73
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Sophia: You know what actually the top one would have been November of 2019

74
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
I was honored with the outstanding alumni award at Mount Royal

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,120
and I was really excited to be there and nervous  about it 

76
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
and my husband couldn't come but my mom and my dad and a bunch of friends came which was amazing.

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,120
My dad who I recently lost in the last 6 months, he was very hillbilly

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,120
and I got to go up there and talk about aviation

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,120
and my dad in a full on voice goes "HOW TO GO 'PHIA!!"

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,120
ha ha ha and tha crowd!

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,120
was like I was just so glad that he was there and was so proud of

82
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,120
me for just being me.

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,120
So I think there you go, you're already said you're already getting

84
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,120
me all tearing up

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,120
just for an important moment.

86
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,120
So yeah.

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,120
That's probably one of the biggest and best 

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Nisha: You're getting me tearing up and I never cry!

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,120
What is a difficult challenge that you've overcome?

90
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Just being a young pilot and getting used

91
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,120
to it. I constantly was like "Am I good enough for this, am I smart enough to do this?"

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,120
I didn't have a ton of mentorship. I had Push and Midas, who was definitely amazing, 

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,120
but I didn't have a lot of of encouragement 

94
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,120
especially as a flight instructor.

95
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,120
So going that path was,

96
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,120
you know lots of people were like "you'll do that and then you move on"

97
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
and I was like "I don't really want to go to the airlines, I kind of like this and teaching  

98
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,120
is sort of my thing". So I had a lot of trouble

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,120
overcoming that that was okay and that I could make my own path

100
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,120
and do what I wanted to do for my lifestyle my family my desires

101
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
my goals that took a long time and then when I could, it was like this

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,120
huge light bulb went off and I could actually make progress with

103
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,120
other things like Elevate, like the Aviation Board and so on and so forth. 

104
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Because it was  like "Oh, hey wait, it's ok to be just you and what you want to do"

105
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Nisha: I think you're a phenomenal role model

106
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,120
like, you're huge role model to me as well.

107
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,120
What is one strength of yours that has helped you in your career?

108
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Sophia: Being stubborn, I think has actually been a strength which is funny

109
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,120
because we're often told "Oh don't be too stubborn". My husband is stubborn as well

110
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,120
and we always say like "This is bad, sometimes our stubbornness beats us!"

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,120
But, I won't give up, I won't quit. Part of that is that stubbornness.

112
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,120
 Even though all that negative self-doubt and all that has been there my whole

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
life and will continue. I appreciate so much that you think of me as a role model, 

114
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,120
but I'm still just me and that's often the case with the people we look up to the most.

115
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Also remembering that they're still human.

116
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
That would be the biggest thing that's helped me just continue and 

117
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,120
kept pushing through as I was just too stubborn to quit sometime.

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Nisha: Persisting after what you really want to go after which is a great quality at the end of the day.

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,120
What is one piece of advice that you would give your younger self?

120
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Sophia: Partly just to be more compassionate to yourself. Recently I've been

121
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,120
learning about self-compassion cuz I'm not very good at it from

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
ike I mentioned before, I was not in a great place when I was 12

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,120
I just kind of all of a sudden got chubby between grades like 4 and 5 sort of thing.

124
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,120
I hung on to that for quite a while and I struggled  and I still, I gotta get out of it

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,120
you know like I'm trying really hard to be more compassionate to myself

126
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
and you know, it sounds silly but like learning how to self talk in a positive manner 

127
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,120
to yourself is actually really hard

128
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,120
So I think I would try to encourage my younger self to try to start doing that sooner instead

129
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
instead of you know, mid-thirties and I'm

130
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
slowly starting to try haha.

131
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Nisha: Never ever too late to start but it's great advice to give someone who's young

132
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,120
so thank you for sharing that, that's great.

133
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,120
What is something you've learned in the past 12 months?

134
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Sophia: It's actually been a pretty good journey! How to Zoom of course ha ha ha ha

135
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,120
and you know, google meetups and hang outs and all these other ones.

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Technology  has definitely been part of that.

137
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,120
I've been working a lot on trying to figure out a little bit more

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,120
about marketing social media and that sort of thing.

139
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,120
I've been doing a lot of that 

140
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,120
For the Edmonton Flying Club as well as just trying like I said a little bit of self-growth

141
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,120
and the Elevate Masterclass and try to find different ways of leadership learning

142
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,120
more about boundaries.

143
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,120
I am the kind of person I get bored easy so I have to keep learning or I'm like "welll I'm bored"

144
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Nisha: What is one thing that you hope to achieve in the next 12 months?

145
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Sophia: I was in a couple of kind of nasty car accidents so 

146
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,120
I've got kind of a messed up neck and back

147
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,120
 so on a small level 

148
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,120
I've been doing a bunch of like P90X challenges

149
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,120
So my big goal there is to try and finish those.

150
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,120
and like, keep going and getting stronger and being proud of myself for that.

151
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,120
On a work level it's just to become a better leader.

152
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,120
I'm always striving to learn more in that sense so that I can be

153
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,120
better for my my own team you a little bit better.

154
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Nisha: Well thank you so much, Sophia for joining us today!

155
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,960
It was lovely to have you on and to get to know you a little bit better.

156
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,200
Sophia: Thank you for having me, Nisha!
