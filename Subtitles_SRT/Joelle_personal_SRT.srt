00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,280
Hi Joelle, thanks for joining us today so we can get to know a little bit more about you.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,360
First, could you tell us a little bit more about yourself and 

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,200
how you became interested in aviation as a professional field?

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,480
Joelle: It's always been a dream. I am Metis and I grew up in northern Ontario 


5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,720
and I lived on Black Sturgeon River and there was a lot of 

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,360
float planes that would take off from there and land and I would watch them and 

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,760
I would watch them and I always dreamed of being a pilot but I don't think I ever actually told anyone. 

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,760
I wasn't, I guess, confident enough to believe that I could do that.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,760
I pursued a bunch of other things in the mean time,

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,240
I have a few degrees in astrophysics, quantum physics and I went to medical school

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,760
and finally I felt like I could pursue aviation and got my recreational pilots license.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,000
From there, I was trying to figure out how I could combine all of my interests

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which are quite varied, and I found out that there is a job 

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
called Flight Surgeon in the Canadian Military and there's an

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
area of medicine called Aerospace Medicine.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,720
From there, I set my goals and I last year I actually accomplished

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,040
the goal of becoming a Flight Surgeon in the Canadian Armed Forces and

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,720
now I'm working towards pursuing an Aerospace Medicine Residency and also

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,720
continuing my flight training to become a commercial pilot.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Iris: Talk about a whole lot of stuff!

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,720
I mean so, for me, I didn't know "Flight Surgeon" existed, so 

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,720
when I was introduced to you, my mind was fully blown because  I was just like

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,720
"Oh my gosh that's, so cool!"

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Congratulations on being able to explore so many different facets of aviation and everything. 

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,720
So what are some of the opportunities that you found through aviation?

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,720
Joelle: Your world honestly gets open to so many things in so many ways

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,720
that you wouldn't have expected.

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,240
For me when I was thinking of doing some flight training, I had no idea

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,720
where to start and this community of women in aviation just like,

30
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,720
exploded in such a wonderful way!

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,720
In Thunder Bay, where I was doing medical school at the time,

32
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,720
there's a group called the Ninety-Nines and that chapter there

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:22,320
is the "Sleeping Giant" chapter and I reached out to them and talked to a few of them 

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
who are actually now really wonderful friends and mentors and

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:32,240
I went to Tim Horton's and had a tea with one pioneer and she told me what I had to do 

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
The community is so welcoming, for example, like I've been flying and 

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,800
I've had some issues with the plane I was flying,

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,240
on New Year's Eve like someone will come out and help you fix your plane

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,800
so it is second to none. The community is one of those things,

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,720
another thing is, I would just say like, adventure.

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,360
I've gotten to do things that I never would have imagined.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,000
A few months ago I got to fly in the F-18 Hornet which is crazy and amazing!

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,880
I got to do my my own adventures in a plane that my partner and I own.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Fly to Nothern Canada and explore you know the vast wilderness.

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,880
The last thing, I actually met my partner through aviation 

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,880
which is really special because we share that love.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,560
Iris: The community is really, it's so embracing and it's so warm and you're just,

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,560
almost taken aback by how many people are willing to welcome you and support you 

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,640
when for so long, I imagine you probably felt a little bit alone or something so, at least I did!


50
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,160
Joelle: I've never been a part of a community so willing to give and support.

51
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,480
I've been trying to give back by taking young women flying in you know 

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,360
their first familiarization flight and I think everyone wants to pay it forward.

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Iris: What is the best piece of advice you've received?

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Joelle: One person that I look up to in so many ways once told me that I was worth it. 

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,240
and it sounds like such a... I don't know maybe a lot of people

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,280
Already know that but for me, it's taken a lot of growth and confidence

57
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,280
to be able to believe that I deserve to be in these communities. 

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,160
So whether it's aviation, or medicine, or the military... 

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,960
It's that kind of support or just that base line, like 

60
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,320
"you deserve to be here" is a really important sentiment that sometimes we get lost in. 

61
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,040
Then another thing recently someone told me is "Don't let people tell you no"

62
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,880
and there's obviously a way to do that respectfully and tactfully but in order

63
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,760
to accomplish some of these goals and you know, be able to excel, I think  

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,480
that in the back of your mind will help move you forward.

65
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,640
Iris: Women in particular I think, under-value their worth and their deservedness

66
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,440
and keeping that front of mind I think is really really important 

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,760
for all women, in all stages of their career.

68
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,880
Joelle: mhmm

69
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,360
Iris: So you you have a lot of passions and so we're calling you a "multi passionate person". 

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,000
What advice would you have for other other women out there who

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,360
have many passions and want to do it all like you are?

72
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,040
Joelle: My advice would be whatever you're doing, whatever stage of life you're in,

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,720
Or area you want to pursue, always be true to yourself.

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
That can be hard at times depending on the culture that you're working in,

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,280
or culture that you come from because they don't always match.

76
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,280
But I think the second thing, if you surround yourself with positive people

77
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,680
or supportive people, which I would say- Women in aviation 100% is, you'll be able to excel.

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Then also being able to, pick your battles.  

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,160
There is always going to be something that doesn't work out right, or the way 

80
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,640
you would hope, and occasionally you're really gonna have to 

81
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,200
put your effort in and try to change that, other times you can accept it.

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,240
Knowing when to do that is an important skill to learn.

83
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,400
Iris: And it feels like that knowledge of which battles to pick is something 

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
that only unfortunately comes with age. Sometimes an experience of 

85
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
"that wasn't my fight, that should not have been the fight that I chose." Ha ha

86
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,360
Joelle: We're gonna live and learn and make mistakes...

87
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,040
Honestly, that's when you're going to grow the most.

88
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,800
It's the hardest part of the journey, but when you look back-

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
That's what defines you.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,680
Iris: What is the best aviation moment you've had?

91
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,120
Joelle: One of my one of my favourite memories, or I guess moments was flying

92
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,600
In my Piper Cherokee over the Churchill River. This was in the spring time and

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,280
The Beluga Whales actually go there to have their babies in the spring,

94
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,720
and I looked down and I saw honestly like a thousand Beluga Whales!

95
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,040
I didn't expect to see that.. My partner with man and he honestly like jumped

96
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,720
out of his seat with joy and I don't know how I could ever top that moment.

97
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,040
Iris: I for sure thought the F-18was going to be there,

98
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,000
but I really think that you trumped it with the beluga whales ha ha.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Joelle: That was cool too ha ha

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Iris: What is a difficult challenge you've overcome?

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Joelle: Being an Indigenous person passing with the dominant society-

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have blonde hair and blue eyes, sometimes puts me in a situation

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,360
of being a wallflower you could say.

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,280
And I frequently hear colonial, inappropriate, racist remarks and

105
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,160
I guess one of the challenges has been to find my voice and to be able to 

106
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,000
speak up when I feel safe in those situations and trying to calculate

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,640
If that's the moment or not, and understanding that it's okay

108
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,480
if I can't speak up or understanding the benefit of doing that 

109
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,640
in that moment to support myself, to support where I come from and who I am.

110
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,240
That's something I'm still learning about and I'm trying to be better at

111
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,480
but that's the challenge that I face frequently.

112
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,040
Iris: And I imagine it's probably a challenge you're going to continuously face

113
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,920
And continuously learn new ways to overcome and manage.

114
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,240
What is a strength of yours that has helped you in your career?

115
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,200
Joelle: Curiosity and also willingness to learn.

116
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,400
Iris: What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger self?

117
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,680
Joelle: I would tell young Joelle to embrace who you are,

118
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,480
Embrace where you come from and also where you want to go and

119
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,440
do that regardless of what people say to you or behind your back 

120
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,520
because you have to be able to believe in this *gestures to self*,
Not what's out there.

121
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,840
Iris: If you could tell my younger self that too, that would be really beneficial ha ha .

122
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,560
What is something new that you've learned in the past year?

123
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,880
Joelle: Yeah so going back to the F-18, I learned how to do a loop 

124
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,000
So that was pretty cool ha ha. But I also learned like


125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,800
obviously we have the pandemic in the back of, I guess our lives right now,

126
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Or the forefront for me as a doctor, but isolation is really hard on everyone 

127
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
and that's something I've learned.

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Iris: We're all gonna have so many challenges coming out of this pandemic 

129
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
from mental health perspective and the aloneness that we've had to experience.

130
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Joelle: mmhm.

131
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Iris: What is one thing you'd like to achieve in the next 12 months?

132
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Joelle: I would like to deploy, that's one of my goals in the military 

133
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,640
and I'm also trying to get my commercial pilot's license. Those are two of my goals.

134
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,000
You have to have goals you know maybe I won't meet them but, I'll try.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,640
Iris: Stretch goals are a really important thing in life!

136
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
Joelle: ha ha yeah

137
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Iris: Joelle, thank you so much for joining us today and letting us get to know 

138
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,480
a little bit more about your I think this is,

139
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
you're going to be inspiring to a lot of women out there just to take a chance

140
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,920
and try as many things as you can and- you're proof! You can do it!

141
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,080
So thank you!
:)

142
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,040
Joelle: Thank you thanks for having me.
:)
