00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,360
So when I was a teenager, I lived in Alberta

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,360
and I had seen a lot of people up in the Cold Lake area

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,360
in uniform when I was driving my sister and myself up 

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,360
to get our braces worked on.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,360
I'd seen them in uniform and I kinda thought

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,360
"That looks pretty cool"

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
However, I didn't really have the confidence in myself as 

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,360
I got older to like 18, 19- I didn't think I could join the military 

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,360
I guess I didn't think I had what it took to be able to

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,360
successfully get through basic training. I was never considered

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,360
an athletic child, at all! I was more of a

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,600
"sit and read a book and hangout by myself" 

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,040
I went into a regular route. I guess in my own thoughts, 

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,040
I had to do that typical-

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,760
Grow up, get a job that was easy to

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,760
accommodate getting married and having kids. 

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,480
I never really thought outside those kind of options.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,120
As a people-pleaser I always kind of felt like I had to do

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,880
what was expected of me and I think that's just mostly an 

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,880
internal pressure. It's not even something that anybody actually

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,880
said to me  like "K, this is the way your life has to go"

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,880
but that was just an internal thing that I had growing up. 

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,880
and it's just again, part of my personality and just trying to like 

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,920
keep everybody else around me happy. I went the route of working.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,840
I got a job in the Oil & Gas industry. When I hit about 28 or 29, 

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,200
I'd actually been depressed for a couple of years with my life. 

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Early mid-crisis I guess you could say....

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,360
So... I got help and...

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,360
I'm glad I struggled through the time that I did because 

30
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,080
it enabled me actually later on in life to reach out and help people 

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
That suffered with mental illness and stuff.

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,200
I needed to change, I needed something changing drastically in my life

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
So I could be happy and feel a bit more fulfilled.

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,120
I had thought originally that it would be to teach.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,120
I thought that would be a good way to give back.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,120
But it didn't feel right for me. One of the reasons was because 

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,120
I was 28 / 29 at the time and I didn't really want to take on

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,120
a full student loan. I looked into other options and I had.

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,880
I had decided- You know what? I want to change my life and 

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,800
I want to do something that gives back and I wanted to 

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,040
take a big challenge and so getting outside of an office 

42
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,680
and getting out of the line of thinking, I went and you know,

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,680
and I said "You know, I'm going to put in my application for

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,680
the military, I'm gonna see what happens and if I can do it!"

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,680
I didn't have a lot of support, or not a ton...

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,680
My family didn't think I'd ever make it through basic training

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,640
but I think in a way that kind of fuelled me a little bit more

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,280
To actually prove to myself that I CAN do something 

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,120
if I put my mind to it.

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,120
I managed to get through it. I remember calling my mom before 

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
we went to the field for basic training and I said 

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
"I'm packing my bags, we're getting out there, I'm excited!"

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,120
and she said to me, "You know what? 

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,120
I didn't think you'd make it. I just did not think you would make it 

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,080
through to this point,  I thought you would be home by now."

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,080
And it just kind of was like "No and I got this!"

57
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Not that it was all easy! There were some struggling days haha

58
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
but I got through it and I think basically, I just want people to know

59
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,800
have confidence in yourself, it's super hard to accept that and you 

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
have to build the confidence in yourself with all 

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
the experiences that you go through in life, but I think, 

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,400
once you realize that you can make it through things-

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,400
it helps build your self esteem, and just know that even if 

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,920
you do try something and you fail... Take it as like a learning

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,400
experience and figure out what went wrong and grow from that.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Don't let it hold you back from trying again or trying something different.

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
I don't think military is necessarily good for everybody and honestly,

68
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,000
A couple times I second guessed it. Because when I was a younger girl 

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I had a friend that was in the Air Cadets and she was 

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
always trying to convince me, she was like 

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
"Come on, join! It's great experience!"

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and I'm like "I'm not wearing a uniform, I don't want to polish my boots

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
or anything!" haha and now.... Here I am 

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So whatever you think is right at one point in your life 

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be right for your whole life.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Have confidence to change what you need to change to be happy!

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And go from there haha
:)
