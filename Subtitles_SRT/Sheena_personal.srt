1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,840
Hi Sheena, thanks so much for taking the time to talk

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,840
to us today so that we can get to know a little bit more

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,840
about you. To start, can you tell us how you became interested

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,840
in aviation and how you came to work in the sector?

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,600
Sheena: I actually came into aviation on total- by chance actually

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,080
it was not... originally I was in the Oil & Gas industry in Alberta

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,000
and I will say I had  somewhat of an early "mid-life crisis"

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I wanted to do something different with my life, I wanted

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,080
Something to do a bit more meaningful. I'd actually applied 

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,800
to university and been accepted for teaching in Alberta and it didn't

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,960
feel quite right, so I looked at the military option and I thought 

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,960
"You know what, I'm going to be 30 soon" and I didn't want 

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,960
to have to like get a huge student loan and debt and I was like

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,960
"I'm going to go the way of the military, get an education, 

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,960
get it paid for, try something completely different,  completely out of my element"

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,960
And I put in my application, and a little while later, 

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,960
I was accepted, And here I am now.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Nisha: How did you end up picking the trade of AVN Tech?

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Sheena: I had a couple different options that I had higher up,

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,960
but I talked with my uncle who is an AVN Tech actually and 

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,760
I had a little discussion with him about some of the other traits

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,240
that I was looking into and he kind of like swayed me towards the

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,920
AVN Tech side of things. I had actually even had my application 

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,520
to be a clerk too because that's what I was familiar with 

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,000
so it was like my backup ha ha.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah an option basically, but I got lucky and I got offered 


27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the position of AVN.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Nisha: "Can you tell me about some of the opportunities

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 that you found through working in aviation?

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sheena: I haven't been in the military that long yet,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 it's not even been 8 years. So already I've got to deploy with the 

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hercules which is when I worked on. I was in Kuwait for ROTO 0.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We were the first ones out in Kuwait with the Hercules and we got

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
To set up there, and get things rolling and that was 

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
a huge experience in itself. I also got to- with 

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,440
a lot of begging and pleading because they were short on my crew, 

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,920
I got to go with Op Renaissance in Indonesia when they-

38
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,920
for disaster relief in 2018 I believe it was.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,880
One of the huge reasons I wanted to join to get to help

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,920
 other people and it was... that was what made the struggle

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,920
to get where am worth it, just in that one trip I feel.

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,960
I've got to fly to a lot of different places, see a lot of places

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,960
I don't think I ever would have seen unless I'd joined the military.

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,560
Even I was lucky enough to get spend about a month in France doing

45
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,960
some training on some different stuff for the aircraft out there.

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,960
It's been a lot of different experiences and traveling the world 

47
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,680
and meeting a lot of people, bonding with people that-

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,680
You don't really think you'll get to bond with people

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,680
 as much as you do, until you're going through the training and

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,680
the traveling and working in super close confined areas

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,000
with them on the aircraft, so it's been very rewarding so far!

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Nisha: I love that you created some of these opportunities

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
for yourself by asking for them!

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sheena: I was 100% on my knees begging my sergeant

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 to just let me go! Because we had a shortage

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
of Techs at the time- which is very typical haha

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,880
and we, on our crew, there wasn't a lot of people and they were

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,520
 trying to call a couple other AVNs to go on the trip and I'm like

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,680
 "You're not finding anybody, please let me go!" Haha

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,040
So, yeah.. They finally gave in and let me go on the trip.

61
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Nisha: So on that note, what is the best piece of advice that

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,040
you've ever received?

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Sheena: When I was a young teenager I don't remember the age exactly,

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
but my granddad said to me

65
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,040
"Smile, it'll get you really far in life vs walking around with a

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,040
Frown on your face"

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,040
and for some reason, it always stuck with me and I try to always 

68
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040
be positive and optimistic about things. Sometimes it's difficult 

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,240
but then it's just like you know, it's much easier to take what you can

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,040
And make it a positive outlook instead.

71
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Nisha: What are three things that you think are crucial to creating success ?

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Sheena: Hard work. 100% hard work.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't think I would have gotten where I am today without hard work 

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and determination, sometimes if it feels difficult you just 

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
got to keep going through it- just know that you're 

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
working towards an end game.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And also don't be afraid to get into uncomfortable situations 

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,840
because if you stay in your happy little comfortable zone,  

79
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280
you're never gonna really experience everything that you could so...

80
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,000
Be uncomfortable haha

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Nisha: What is your best aviation moment?

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Sheena: 100% helping with the disaster relief in Indonesia.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,800
There was one point where I was on the plane and we're flying

84
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,000
some of the people there out of the disaster area and we had

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,240
like they all had just a little bag of belongings but they were so happy and so grateful!

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,240
Nisha: That sounds like such a rewarding experience!

87
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Even though it would have been so difficult at the time that you

88
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
were going through it.

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Sheena: There was a lot of little kids there that we helped,

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,240
so it was... they were just so happy and thankful haha <3

91
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Nisha: What is a difficult challenge that you've had to overcome?

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Sheena: I would say for myself the most difficult challenge is...

93
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,240
my size. I'm not even quite 5'2" a lot of the gear in military is

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,240
made for people that are taller than me. 

95
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,240
A lot of the equipment that we use is heavy.

96
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,240
A lot of times when I was on the flight line,

97
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,240
working with people.. They would see my size and feel like

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,240
they needed to help me do things.

99
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,120
Which kind of motivated me into sometimes work a little bit harder 

100
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,000
Or overcompensate which isn't necessarily the greatest thing to do 

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but I think as people started working with me they saw

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that I was capable, and if not then I would just ask for help.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,360
And I would try to find times that my size was beneficial.

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,680
Like my hands are kind of small so they fit nice  in tight spots in the engine. 

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,680
So I would find times when I was useful to climb into

106
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
the little tiny areas to get the jobs done 

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,680
that other people couldn't fit into or stuff. So you've just 

108
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,680
got to deal with it, but that is 100% one of the more

109
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,680
normal day to day struggles I have. It's just my size haha

110
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Nisha: A lot of times when we look at like "paving the way"

111
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,680
and what that looks like, we forget that this is exactly

112
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,680
what it looks like. It looks like challenging the everyday stereotypes.

113
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Finding ways to show people that being different is not necessarily 

114
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,680
a disadvantage. So thank you for doing that

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,680
for the other AMEs  that are coming up behind you that are small!

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,040
Sheena: Just do what you have to do in order to enjoy your life really.

117
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,960
Nisha: What would you say is a strength of yours that

118
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,960
has helped you in your career?

119
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Sheena: My hard work. I have a pretty strong work ethic I like to-

120
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
and it can be to a detriment too sometimes.

121
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,920
Sometimes I have to like, remember it is a job...

122
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,800
I still have to like remember to breathe sometimes,

123
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,800
let the work stuff like just kind of not be hanging over my head so much

124
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
But, it's something that I take a lot of pride in so I will

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,680
give a job or task everything I can and then it means a lot to me

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,680
and my career is what means a lot to me so  yeah.

127
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,000
I would say, my hard work and determination.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,320
Nisha: What is one piece of advice that you  would give to your younger self?

129
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Sheena: Have more confidence in yourself ha ha.

130
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Don't second guess yourself as much as you did and just,

131
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,320
know that you can do things when you put your mind to it.

132
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Nisha: What is something new that you've learned in the last year?

133
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Sheena: I've learned how to tile! Haha

134
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,320
I did a bathroom reno and it sounds so weird but it's something

135
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,320
I've never done before haha.

136
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,960
And I was doing tiling and I get in "the zone" when I'm working

137
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,960
on little detail things and I just kind of like, tune things out.

138
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
So it could be a good thing or bad thing but I loved it 

139
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,960
but I hated it at the same time.. It was just like 

140
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,960
every little measurement and it's very detail oriented and yeah

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,560
I was pretty proud of the fact that I got to work on that.

142
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Nisha: I think that state of focus is called "flow"

143
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,560
and it's supposed to be really good for you, so I'm glad you got

144
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,560
to use it in a project that brought you so much joy!

145
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,560
And my last question for you is-  what is one thing that 

146
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,560
you want to achieve in the next 12 months?

147
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Sheena: I would love to travel again but probably not 

148
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,560
going to happen with all the restrictions that we have in place 

149
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,560
right now... However I'm planning currently for 

150
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
a back country trip for camping in Algonquin and

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm kind of looking forward to that, it's something that 

152
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,560
I wanted to do for a very long time and I've never had...

153
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,560
I could have taken the opportunity but I guess I was a little bit scared.

154
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,920
So we have a friend that is very experienced at that so we're

155
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,240
kind of piggy backing and getting a first experience on that one,

156
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,960
so I'm really looking forward to it, hopefully all the restrictions are lifted 

157
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,560
so we're able to get out there and  actually give it a go.

158
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Nisha: Well Algonquin is a beautiful place to do something like that,

159
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,560
I hope you get to do it and I hope you have a blast!

160
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Sheena: I'm hopeful, thanks!

161
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Nisha: Thanks for joining us today Sheena,

162
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,560
and for talking to us about how you got into aviation.

163
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,560
It's really great to get to know you a little bit better.
:)

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Sheena: Thanks again for me chatting with me,

165
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
it's been fun!
:)
