1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,200
Hi Sophia. Thanks so much for joining us today.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,560
Can you tell us a little bit about how you got into the field of Aviation?

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Sophia: Hi Nisha it's lovely to be here, thanks for having me!

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm from a small town in southern Alberta called Crowsnest Pass and we had a gentleman that moved into my little neighbourhood and

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:28,920
he just was like the kind of person  that I would say "oozed cool" and he actually said "Sophia, you should join Air Cadets!"

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,680
and I was like "Nooooo..." You know, I get picked on and I was chubby and just like not in a good spot in my headspace.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,040
Later on we found out he's a fighter pilot with the Canadian Forces. So no wonder he "oozed cool" right? He was one of those people.

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,880
One of those "Amazing, look what you've done!" kind of people. But he kept encouraging me,

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,840
So finally, I just did it so he would stop bugging you need me

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,520
I joined, and I didn't like it at first at  all, I had to go put my hair

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,520
up in a bun, ironically. I had to polish boots, I had to learn how to iron

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,200
I was like "Oh this is no fun, this is too hard!". My parents actually taught me such a huge lesson then that I'll never forget:

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,360
"No no no, you signed up for this. Give it an honest try, give it a year. If you still don't like it after a year, fine you can quit"

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,120
I grumbled and whatever else and I started actually liking it. I'm loud, so I started getting good at drills and the marching side of it and the commands of it.

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,680
And I started making friends and just feeling like I found my community and my place.

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,200
Close to the end of that year, this pilot, his call sign was "Midas"

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,880
He brought an F-18 down to Lethbridge - I fell in love with that thing!

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,160
Like it was just this big cool airplane and I was terrified of him and everything, still being very insecure at that age.

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,080
but you know, walked around and get  to touch it and talk about it and all the stuff at the end of the day,

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,720
He went to leave and he took off and let us all stand on the apron and I remember like hands on the ears because it was so loud.

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,320
and I just felt my whole body go "Oh my god, this is cool!"

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,760
It was like I fell in love and someone hit me over the head and said "Airplanes, you gotta do that!"

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,560
Nisha: So what are some of the opportunities you've found through Aviation?

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,800
Sophia: The people,  that's my favourite part!

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,560
Including yourself and everyone at CWIA. People are generally really excited and happy 

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,800
There's opportunity to go wherever you want to go with it. 

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,240
I've got to go all over the place as a pilot.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,520
I've got to go to different conferences as a female pilot and really explore that..

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,160
Speaking engagements and just learning different things such as you know,

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,680
being on boards and what not as well so, it's endless really!

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,840
Nisha: You need to say it again for people in the back because that's another thing that I really love about being part of this industry as well!

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,920
What is the best piece of advice that you received?

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,760
I'm in the master class with Elevate Aviation right now - different speakers from Kathy Fox with the TSB,

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,760
and Nicole Girard with Transport Canada, so many amazing people that give you different advice

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,960
it's really hard to go through it all and find out what matters to you at a certain point in your life. 

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,040
The best advice I ever was given and that is sort of my motto to this day is to aim high and never give up.

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,720
I just I try to live by that in general. There's no such thing as dreaming too big, it just might take you longer

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,960
Nisha: What are three things you would say are crucial to creating success? 

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,760
Sophia: Part of it is as believing in yourself and knowing that it's okay when you don't.

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,000
I've had lots of conversations with other women in aviation and that's

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,640
always a question of "Well I don't have everything on this box ticked off so I can't apply for that job"

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,320
or "Well, I'm okay, but I'm not great". 

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,800
You know, it's all our own self criticisms that will sometimes hold us back.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,640
"OK I can do this, oooh god I'm scared... But I'm still gonna try! ". That push forward-

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,720
So I guess, I don't know if you would call that tenacity, but that was a big part of it.

46
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,600
As well as just being able to be honest with yourself about what your failures are 

47
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,880
I've definitely failed A LOT and that's okay.

48
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,600
You learn from each of those and you try to get better. 

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,280
In Aviation, that's  pushed constantly, safety is number one across the board

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,600
every time anybody in this whole industry has failed, we've analyzed the heck out of it 

51
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,080
and tried to go "Ok, so how do we make it better?"

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,640
How do we grow?

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,560
How do I make it safer for everyone else?" I love that now, but

54
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,640
it took a while to get used to because it's like 

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,640
"Oh god I did something wrong, don't look at me!"

56
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,680
But look at me, let's learn, let's grow, let's figure it out!

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,400
The other one is- Don't ever bring a bridge. It's a very small industry.

58
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,800
I remember when I was in Aviation College, there was somebody that,

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,480
we just didn't click right, I thought "I really don't like this person." 

60
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,880
And then I was like "This is mean, I'm being mean, stop it!" and he was kind of mean 

61
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
and I kept hearing "Don't burn a bridge Sophia, don't burn a bridge"

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,360
like later we became friends and I'm so grateful for it,  it's echoed  throughout my whole career

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,800
you know being kind to people trying to find ways to 

64
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,080
even if you're not going to be best friends. That's okay, but don't burn a bridge.

65
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,040
Nisha: The gravity that your insecurity has; especially as a young woman I find that you have to work 

66
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
so hard to overcome that. The last thing you said about Burning Bridges, man I can tell

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,360
you I feel that right now some days. That's phenomenal advice

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,600
to kind of take that long-term perspective on things.

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,440
What is your best Aviation moment?

70
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,040
Sophia: You know what actually the top one would have been November of 2019

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,760
I was honoured with the outstanding alumni award at Mount Royal

72
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,480
and I was really excited to be there and nervous  about it 

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,080
and my husband couldn't come but my mom and my dad and a bunch of friends came which was amazing.

74
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,680
My dad who I recently lost in the last 6 months, he was very hillbilly

75
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
and I got to go up there and talk about aviation

76
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,640
and my dad in a full on voice goes "HOW TO GO 'PHIA!!" ha ha ha and tha crowd!

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,640
was like I was just so glad that he was there and was so proud of

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,680
me for just being me.

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,880
So I think there you go, you're already said you're already getting

80
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,240
me all tearing up just for an important moment. So yeah.

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,120
That's probably one of the biggest and best 

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,000
Nisha: You're getting me tearing up and I never cry!

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,200
What is a difficult challenge that you've overcome?

84
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,160
Just being a young pilot and getting used

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,880
to it. I constantly was like "Am I good enough for this, am I smart enough to do this?"

86
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,240
I didn't have a ton of mentorship. I had Push and Midas, who was definitely amazing, 

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,160
but I didn't have a lot of of encouragement  especially as a flight instructor.

88
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,600
So going that path was, you know lots of people were like "you'll do that and then you move on"

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,720
and I was like "I don't really want to go to the airlines, I kind of like this and teaching  

90
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,600
is sort of my thing". So I had a lot of trouble

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,480
overcoming that that was okay and that I could make my own path

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,160
and do what I wanted to do for my lifestyle my family my desires, my goals 

93
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
that took a long time and then when I could, it was like this

94
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
huge light bulb went off and I could actually make progress with

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,080
other things like Elevate, like the Aviation Board and so on and so forth. 

96
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,560
Because it was  like "Oh, hey wait, it's ok to be just you and what you want to do"

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,320
Nisha: I think you're a phenomenal role model

98
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,080
like, you're huge role model to me as well.

99
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,240
What is one strength of yours that has helped you in your career?

100
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,400
Sophia: Being stubborn, I think has actually been a strength which is funny

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,080
because we're often told "Oh don't be too stubborn". My husband is stubborn as well

102
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,480
and we always say like "This is bad, sometimes our stubbornness beats us!"

103
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,200
But, I won't give up, I won't quit. Part of that is that stubbornness.

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,720
Even though all that negative self-doubt and all that has been there my whole

105
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,320
life and will continue. I appreciate so much that you think of me as a role model, 

106
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,280
but I'm still just me and that's often the case with the people we look up to the most.

107
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,160
Also remembering that they're still human.

108
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,520
That would be the biggest thing that's helped me just continue and 

109
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,120
kept pushing through as I was just too stubborn to quit sometime.

110
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,480
Nisha: Persisting after what you really want to go after which is a great quality at the end of the day.

111
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,040
What is one piece of advice that you would give your younger self?

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,640
Sophia: Partly just to be more compassionate to yourself. Recently I've been

113
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,480
learning about self-compassion cuz I'm not very good at it.

114
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,480
From like I mentioned before, I was not in a great place when I was 12

115
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,280
I just kind of all of a sudden got chubby between grades like 4 and 5 sort of thing.

116
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I hung on to that for quite a while and I struggled  and I still, I gotta get out of it

117
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,480
you know like I'm trying really hard to be more compassionate to myself

118
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,480
and you know, it sounds silly but like learning

119
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,480
how to self talk in a positive manner to yourself is actually really hard

120
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,480
So I think I would try to encourage my younger self to try to start doing that sooner instead

121
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,720
instead of you know, mid-thirties and I'm slowly starting to try haha. 

122
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,680
Nisha: Never ever too late to start but it's great advice to give someone who's young so thank you for sharing, that's great.

123
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,640
What is something you've learned in the past 12 months?

124
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,760
Sophia: It's actually been a pretty good journey! How to Zoom of course ha ha ha ha

125
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,000
and you know, google meetups and hang outs and all these other ones.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,560
Technology  has definitely been part of that. I've been working a lot on trying to figure out a little bit more

127
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,800
about marketing social media and that sort of thing. I've been doing a lot of that 

128
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,360
For the Edmonton Flying Club as well as just trying like I said a little bit of self-growth

129
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,800
and the Elevate Masterclass and try to find different ways of leadership learning more about boundaries.

130
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,240
I am the kind of person I get bored easy so I have to keep learning or I'm like "welll I'm bored"

131
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Nisha: What is one thing that you hope to achieve in the next 12 months?

132
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,480
Sophia: I was in a couple of kind of nasty car accidents so 

133
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I've got kind of a messed up neck and back

134
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,640
so on a small level  I've been doing a bunch of like P90X challenges

135
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,280
So my big goal there is to try and finish those.

136
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,200
and like, keep going and getting stronger and being proud of myself for that.

137
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,600
On a work level it's just to become a better leader. I'm always striving to learn more in that sense so that I can be
