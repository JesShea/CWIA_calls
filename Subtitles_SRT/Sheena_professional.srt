1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,640
Hi Sheena, thanks so much for taking the time

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,640
to be with us today so that we can get to know a little bit more 

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,640
about what you do you. To start, can you tell us a little bit

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,640
about your position?

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,640
Sheena: Normally when you start as an AVN Tech,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,640
you're working directly with the aircraft.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,640
You're training, you're working directly with aircraft,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,640
you're working on problems with like fuel snags or

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,640
hydraulics for you can be fixing/changing a tire, 

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
you could be parking an airplane. There's a lot of different

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,640
things that you're doing, hands on, outside, different weather-

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,640
rain, snow.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,480
It's- any day is different when you're out on the first line. That's what I did for a 

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,480
good chunk of my career so far. 

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Following that, I went to an office position where I was looking

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,480
At paperwork making sure all the airworthiness paperwork

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,480
was correct and that was a very big learning experience also.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,480
And then from there, I actually applied for a QULLIQ

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,480
which is what I'm currently working with, it's a small team

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,480
That was started up in 2020 and basically our job-

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,480
it's a very big scope but currently we're working on improving

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,800
communications within RCAF, and we're basically being formed

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,520
As an enabler for innovation within RCAF. So we're

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,520
kind of helping the doers out there, "do the innovation" and

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,520
We're kind of in the background trying to connect all the people

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,520
that need to be connected in the right spots.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Nisha: What made you apply for a position on the QULLIQ team?

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Sheena: So it was very different. Right from the get go,

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,240
it was just completely different way to get on the team.

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,880
It's not typical to apply for a position in the military,

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,880
in this one, it was taking an application-

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,880
there was a very broad scope of what they were looking for,

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,440
previous experience that I had with some project management

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,240
and office skills and stuff.

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,880
I kind of have that experience and then I had "on aircraft"

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,120
experience. I did a little bit of flying with aircraft so

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,880
I kind of saw some of the aircrew side of things. So,

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,880
I kind of ticked off a lot of the boxes that they

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,880
were looking for but, I had no idea what they were actually

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,880
gonna be doing. There's not really any full, clear guidelines

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Of what your job would be, so I put in my application and

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Thought that I have nothing to lose from putting in an

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,880
application, so I might as well! 

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,880
and it just sounded exciting because I didn't really

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,880
know what I would be doing.

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,800
People ask "Why did you even apply for it?" And I'm like -

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Because I didn't was going to be doing, like I could be making coffee for 

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
people or I could be doing something..  I didn't know!

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
and it kind of sounded interesting in that way.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Nisha: What unique strengths do you bring to the team then?

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Sheena: I like doing little tasks, I like getting organized,

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
I like helping people get organized so I think there's that.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
I try to stay pretty positive I'm hard worker I think all those 

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,080
kind of are good skills and just all the general different

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,720
experiences that I've had in my life pre-military and with 

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,720
the military I think it helps give a different viewpoint 

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,720
on things that we're tackling and working on.

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,520
Nisha: What is the coolest thing that you have gotten to do professionally?

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Sheena: There's been a lot of really cool things!

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,520
Again the helping with humanitarian aid in Indonesia was

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,760
probably one of my highlights because that's one of the reasons

62
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,760
I joined because I wanted to be part of something that was

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Making a difference in other people's lives.

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,760
It was 2018 and I went with a small crew, we were helping 

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,760
With disaster relief in Indonesia when things were 

66
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,760
pretty rough for people down there so we were helping 

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,520
fly people out of disaster areas and flying supplies into

68
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,760
The areas that needed it. We were working with a lot of 

69
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
different countries and it was neat to see all the different

70
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,760
people working together and just to help each other out.

71
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,000
It was an experience I won't forget any time soon.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The people in Indonesia are amazing!

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They're all so happy and like positive and...

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I loved it there haha!

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The kind of have a piece of my heart for sure.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Nisha: Yeah I always think it's really so touching when you

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
go to a place that's been impacted by a disaster and you still

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
see this vibrant kind of like, welcoming culture.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think that's probably one of my favourite components

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Of traveling with the Air Force to these

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
different parts of the world.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sheena: Yeah, 100%!

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's something that you don't soon forget.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Nisha: If you could ask your role model anything,  what would it be?

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sheena: I don't actually have a role model.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's never been any one person in particular

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that I looked up to. I sometimes learn from what I feel is

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
defeating for myself and think I don't want to do that

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,040
for other people so I kind of try to like,

90
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Learn more from the bad stuff that happens.

91
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,040
As weird as that is and then try to think

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,040
"Hey I want to do better and I want to like, be the best person I can be" 

93
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,720
and not necessarily look to somebody else. Everybody has

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,600
their own experiences in life and whatever got somebody else

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,600
to the spot that they are isn't going to be the same kind of

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,960
experiences that are going to get me there, so I feel like

97
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
it's just best to work on your own self development.

98
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Nisha: First of all I think making your own way is a really 

99
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,960
great approach, but I don't think it's really weird to

100
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,960
learn from the bad things that happen, it's just a 

101
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,960
different way of thinking about things. Different people get 

102
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,960
inspired by different things, and I think I'm the same as you.

103
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,960
I get inspired by wanting to continuously improve and so I'm constantly looking 

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
for different ways that I can learn from 

105
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
my environment, on how I can improve myself right.

106
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,960
So I wouldn't necessarily call that weird, and my last 

107
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,960
question for you today is- what is one piece of advice 

108
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,960
you would give someone on creating professional success?

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Sheena: Go for what motivates you.

110
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Don't go for what other people think you should be doing.

111
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,000
Go for what motivates you and makes you happy and fulfilled

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
and I think that will bring a determination to yourself that

113
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,080
will motivate you and help create your own success.

114
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,760
Live for yourself basically, don't live for other people.

115
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Nisha: I love that piece of advice.

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,760
I think it took me awhile to get there, but living that way 

117
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,760
has been really rewarding.

118
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,520
Sheena: Myself too! It's something that, it takes awhile 

119
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,920
to get to know that part of yourself and accept it, but I think 

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,920
it's the best way to go for myself, so far anyway.

121
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Nisha: Takes a little bit of time to figure out where 

122
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,920
you want to go in life and it's worth it to spend that

123
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,920
time trying to figure that out. Thank you so much Sheena,

124
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,920
for joining us today and for sharing with us what your

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,920
work looks like. We appreciate your time!
:)

126
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Sheena: Thank you very much for having me again!
:)
