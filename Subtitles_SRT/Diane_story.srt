1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,160
So over the years, as a pilot, I've had some great 

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,160
opportunities to visit many different countries,

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,440
meet many different people, it's been fascinating actually.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,240
And I would say that as you grow up, you understand the value 

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,560
of being accountable and you don't really know what that means, 

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Until you actually experience it. 

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,560
You know- your parents can tell you, your friends can tell you,

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,560
you can see it from others, you can read about it-

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,560
and I think that something that was really remarkable for me,

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,560
was the time that I was deployed in Afghanistan flying the Hercules

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,560
and you know, you work autonomously, you've got a crew,

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,560
And you fly around intra-Afghanistan and stuff and you do

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,560
remarkable things actually.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,560
So, the thing that really strikes me as you know,

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,560
A growth period in my life, was this particular deployment.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,560
When we landed and we picked up a load- in general 

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,560
you get this matrix of what you're going to have. 

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Every day you're leg 1 - leg 2 - leg 3,

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,560
and you're going to offload this load and onload that load- 

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,560
but really they're all completely wrong!

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,560
This one particular day, we landed and the load that we received

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Was completely not what I expected. 

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,560
You know, and it required me to use all those decision-making 

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,560
tools I had in my bag and you know, make a decision-

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,560
"Do I take the load, or don't I"

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,560
So I decided to you know go back to the Herc,

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
the engines were running, you know my headset cords dangling

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,560
into the back of the cargo compartment, I'm talking to the loadmaster 

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,560
and some of the special forces that were meeting us at the plane 

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,560
and I thought you know, everything seemed legit,

31
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,560
it seems safe, there was no issue with you know,

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,640
foremost the safety of my crew and the aircraft so I had about

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
35 seconds between you know, leaving the back of the ramp and

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
getting back to the cockpit to decide 

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,640
"What am I going to do?"

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Because I knew exactly, when I plug that headset cord back in,

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,640
that my whole crew would be you know, waiting...

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,640
"What are we doing? What's going on? What's your decision?"

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
So you know, I plug my headset in, and I put my seat belt back on, and you know, I decided 

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,640
"Ok, we're going to take the load. We'll take it, and let's go."

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,520
So we took it, and we finished our day. We dropped off the load 

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
at destination and you know, I got back and it was weighing on my mind,

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,520
to say "Well really, was that the best idea?"

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,520
You know, was that the best decision? 

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,520
And you know, at the end of the day, like that was a huge lesson for me

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,520
because it was the best decision for me as far as taking the load 

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Was concerned but, you know, I had to take a lot of time after that

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,520
to explain to the leadership why that decision was good.

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,800
Meanwhile, the whole crew was nicely tucked in their tents, 

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,520
sleeping away and here I was being accountable for my actions and 

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,520
I was very much responsible.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,520
It was a lesson to me that there was nobody else responsible 

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,520
for what's going on in that plane. That ultimately, it's me.

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,520
You know, you hear about it, we teach it, you read about it,

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,520
but until you go through those lessons in life,

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,520
to be accountable for your decisions and your responsibility and 

57
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,000
take that seriously- then you're really hoisted on board.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,520
So I think accountability, in general, of who you are-

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,520
is really something that has marked me. 

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,520
In the words I choose, in how I treat people, everything! 

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,520
It all comes to me. So I think that's something that if I

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,160
were to talk to my 2 daughters for example, and I would express to them, you know, 

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,160
What should I -what should you shoot for in life?

64
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Well first of all, you have to be mindful of who you are.

65
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Who are you and what you want to do, but then you know it's...

66
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,160
you have to take accountability for your actions and who you are 

67
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,160
and what you want and take those steps to create the life that you want.

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Because if you know, 20 years goes by and you're not happy in the situation-

69
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,160
That you know, you're kind of wondering, "what happened?"

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Well, you're accountable for that. So, if I were to sum up 

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,160
all of that- this opportunity to be a pilot, and make those decisions.

72
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,160
The accountability of those decisions is really mine.

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,160
I think that's a great opportunity and I'm really happy to have chosen 

74
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,680
a life as a pilot or in aviation in general where are you have the balance 

75
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,160
between safety and excitement and satisfaction of working with the team and people 

76
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,520
and ultimately though, I'm responsible. The self-growth you get from that is,

77
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,520
you can't compare it to anything else.

78
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
So I would say that you know, for everyone here -

79
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
that's joined in on this exciting Canadian Women In Aviation conference,

80
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm happy to be a part of it and I know there's lots of 

81
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,520
other stories out there that..

82
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,520
And great, strong, women that can contribute to this

83
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,520
great connection, this great conversation that we're having.

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Yes so be accountable... 

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,520
that would be my story.
:)
