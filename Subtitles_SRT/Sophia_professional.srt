00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:15,520
Hi Sophia, thanks so much for being here with us today so that we can get to know a little bit more about what you do. To start, can you tell us about your position and what it entails?

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,640
Sophia: So my main job is I am the Chief Flight Instructor with the Edmonton Flying Club. 

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:28,040
So that means I'm a pilot and I teach people how to fly but I also manage a bunch of other instructors who do the same thing at various different levels. 

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:37,040
I manage the team, maintain operational control, I adhere by the Transport Canada box and basically 

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,000
I work with a great team of other instructors who will teach everything from that first private pilot 

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,760
license from commercial, multi engine, instrument  and one of my favourites is instructing new 

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,960
instructors. Then with that I am also the pilot examiner. It's for Transport Canada but I do a lot of 

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,760
the exams at EFC as well. 

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,160
and it's just you know making sure I'm holding to the standards that are set to try and make the best pilots we can.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,480
Nisha: You're also an active volunteer so could you tell us a bit about what some of the volunteer positions you hold are?

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,880
Sophia: Sure, one of my favourites of course is I'm the Director of Community Engagement and 

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,400
Mentorship with Elevate Aviation. I also am a director or board member with the Alberta Aviation 

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,440
Museum as well as with the Alberta Aviation Council.

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,240
Nisha: Wow so you're part of 2 boards, and boards are kind of these mysterious organizations that 

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,640
a lot of people in aviation don't know about so could you demystify it for us a little bit? What do you do as a board member?

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,040
Sophia: Depending on the organization once a month or once every couple of months where most people 

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
that care about the organization get together and discuss some of the big things.

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
Especially financial and strategic planning for the future things like that. 

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,360
So after sitting on a couple meetings at the Flying Club, I actually kind of fell upon the Alberta Aviation one by accident.

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:03,040
I'm a huge fan of the museum, and they felt like kind of slowly starting after the City Centre Airport was shut down; 

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,400
people didn't know about it, or they thought it closed, and I was at a few different events actually 

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,320
with Elevate and the Flying Club- you know running a booth at Women in Aviation Day or something like that. 

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,120
I met the President of the Board and she was amazing and we started chatting a bit she said 

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,080
"You know the funny thing is, I'm the youngest person on the board I'm 65, and I'm the only woman!"

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
I just asked like "How do I... Can I help?"

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,720
And she says "Well we're actually looking for Directors"

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,160
And I was like "Could I try?"
And she said "I will nominate you today!"

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,800
And I was just like "Cool! Ok shoot... What did I sign up for.."

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,440
So to be honest I kind of fell upon it and fell into it by accident just because I was like you know what, 

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm young or younger than 65 haha and a female and I'd be happy to help. 

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,040
I love the museum and I'd like to see where it can go in the future and maybe my insights will help a little 

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,200
or at least I could learn more about who I can look for to maybe recommend somebody to replace me if I'm not the right fit.

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:09,680
So it was completely by accident that I first got into it I guess but honestly it's about meeting and getting together and

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,360
trying to think about what the goals of the organization are and how to move it forward

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,800
so whether it's financial plans- like during Covid we've had quite a few meetings about what grants

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,840
can we apply for and helping the staff find those grants

37
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,040
and helping them find good writers for those grants and you know what can you apply for to keep the staff going

38
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,520
and and that sort of thing so it's honestly it's about having honest conversations for the most part 

39
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:44,680
and everybody has their own background, has their own connections that attribute and can make a board really great and really strong.

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,520
Nisha: Can you talk to us a little bit about what the process was like? 
Sophia: It depends on the board to be honest. 

41
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,800
So with the Alberta Aviation Museum I had to fill out an application form and submit that and then 

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,520
they put my name towards the board and the President actually talked a little bit about who I was

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,120
And a few of the board members knew me so they said "oh yep, Sophia is this and this..."

44
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,880
and then they had to vote on it and go you know "yes, no, maybe so"

45
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,680
Then every year you still get re-elected if you put yourself forward and if the sustaining members of 

46
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,920
the organization like what you're doing and feel like you're good to be there

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,000
Or it might be the board that thinks that you're good to be there; they'll continue to you know vote you in per se.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,160
Some will do it more formally like at the Alberta Aviation Museum it's really formal. 

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Others I've seen where everybody just goes "yep, you're good to go, I think you're fine"

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,640
 or it's "Are there any objections?" and nobody says anything.. "Ok, you're a board member again" ha ha ha

51
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,720
It really depends. With the Alberta Aviation Council, again I was kind of approached and asked to be a part of it.

52
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,960
and and I didn't even know what the Alberta Aviation Council was at that time so it was a really good 

53
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,720
thing for me to you know jump in and learn about

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,560
and again same sort of thing, my name was put forward and I had to fill out a form about who I was 

55
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,680
and kind of what my little bio was and from that I was elected onto the Board. 

56
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,040
So it's not a complicated process for the most part. 

57
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,520
Some boards like for example; the Edmonton International Airport Board- for something like that, 

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,920
it's a little more complicated.  There's a bigger application process and you may not get selected the first time but it's also if you 

59
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,480
put your name forward once, then you kind of stay in a pool often and later on people might be like

60
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,320
"oh wait, wait, wait, wait - this personal applied a couple years ago and I see they've been doing 

61
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,720
really great things, and they have this-  and we need this now, so let's maybe pull them in."

62
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,680
So it does you know it does depend on the board and what they're looking for but some of them are 

63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
crazy easy and others are more complicated.

64
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,920
Nisha: It sounds a lot like you just need to take a chance and put yourself out there.

65
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,360
Sophia: 100%

66
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,160
Nisha: Why do you think it's important for women- especially young women, to be part of Boards?

67
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,120
Sophia: I think it's about perspective. You know... 

68
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,680
"You don't know what you don't know" is something that I've been thinking about a lot lately because it's come up. 

69
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,360
There's so many things I have no idea about, there's so much history in different places 

70
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,480
like especially the museum, the Alberta Aviation Council. and I want to learn more too, 

71
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:16,160
So it's another way for me to learn but it's also so that I can carry that forward, right?

72
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Having you know, a more senior Board is amazing but you want to be able to carry that knowledge and not lose it.

73
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,840
You know so if in three years there's a full turnover on the board because a bunch of them have retired-

74
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,280
where's all that knowledge? It's gone!

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,520
So if we don't start putting younger people on boards to learn from that and grow and you know

76
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,600
and encourage that like connection.. You're gonna lose all that experience.

77
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,680
The other aspect of it it's just different perspectives different ideas.

78
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,720
Even just you know, you and I - living in different cities, there's certain things that you're going 

79
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,440
to think about that I'm not and vice versa

80
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,600
and it's the same thing as being different ages, different gender, race, backgrounds whatever it might be 

81
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,560
perspective and that diversity, is huge for growth.

82
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,360
Nisha: How has your volunteer experience helped support your goals?

83
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,840
Sophia: My biggest thing is I want to change the world.

84
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,960
I think lots of us, you know, put it as simple as that.

85
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,400
That's the big dream, I want to change the world and I remember before I found Elevate especially

86
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,760
in conversations with my partner of being like "I just, I'm not doing enough. I feel wrong, I don't 

87
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,320
feel whole because I'm not volunteering enough I'm just, not doing anything."

88
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,760
And it really caused me personal heartache because it was like I was missing a chunk of me or something 

89
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,920
and in some ways I kind of think that me finding Elevate or Elevate finding me, 

90
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,440
that it could help me fill that hole and give me a way to try to work towards the actual goal of you know,

91
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:47,840
changing the world. It probably is in a very small way and that's ok and maybe I'll hopefully try to  make it bigger and better all the time.

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,080
But it's it's just helped me to find that community to work towards those goals and 

93
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,440
to learn what some new goals are and how to actually achieve that idea of  "How do I help the world? How do I make it a better place?"

94
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,480
Nisha: A lot of people that I know, especially through CWIA, feel very very similarly and my story 

95
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,520
with CWIA is very similar to what you're talking about with Elevate. 

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,800
"I have so much energy and potential where can I channel it?"

97
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,960
and I just stumbled into this opportunity and took it up.

98
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,440
Sophia: Give it a try! Like what's the worst thing that happens? 
You get told no? Then try something else ha ha

99
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,920
Nisha: Yep! Last question, what advice do you have for women who want to get more involved with their communities?

100
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,960
Aside from the "put yourself out there"

101
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,200
Sophia: Don't be afraid when you get told "no". To try again.

102
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:42,480
It's really easy for that to happen as well. Sometimes it's just about doing some research trying to find what's out there.

103
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Like I said I personally didn't even know about some of these things 

104
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,800
and so it was quite literally asking some questions and being curious and letting my curiosity be ok.

105
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,800
I think we're sometimes afraid to ask questions which I'm also personally trying to work on.

106
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
Being like "Well I actually want to learn about this"

107
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
So I mean you know; just ask the questions and see what it takes you.

108
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,720
Nisha: At times I used to just internalize the "no" as rejection then I said
"Not right now, we don't need that right now"

109
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,920
Nisha: You know, let it pass by right?
Sophia: Yeah, things happen for a reason, and I don't know what it is but it's there ha ha.

110
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:24,480
Nisha: Yeah, thank you so much Sophia for joining us today. It was lovely getting to know what you do 

111
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,480
And thank you so much for sharing your insight into what it's like being a board member on the 

112
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Alberta Aviation Museum and with the Alberta Aviation Council.

113
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Sophia: Thanks so much for having me! :)
