00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,320
Hi Allison, thanks for being with us today so we can

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,320
get to know a little bit more about your role with Porter Airlines.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,320
Allison: Good morning

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Iris: To start, could you talk a little bit about your position?

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,320
Allison: Absolutely, I am currently the Director of 

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,320
System Operation Control, also known as SOC. 

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,320
My day to day responsibilities kind of really depend 

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,320
on how the airline is operating in the day.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,320
So if we had a blue skies across the network you know, I'm with 

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
my management team working on technology and

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,320
process improvement, communication, those types of things. 

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,320
But, if there are resource shortages or weather challenges, 

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,320
it's all hands on deck in that Ops Center.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,320
So it can be a little challenging at times and often your priorities 

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,920
are rearranged for you at a moments notice.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
You know, you need to adapt, but it's certainly very exciting 

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
and no day is ever the same.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Iris: And how did you move into your role?

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Allison: I came to Porter Airlines about 7 years ago 

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,920
as a Duty Officer. So that position is really the point person

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,960
in the day to day operation and it gave me a chance to learn 

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,280
Porter's operation and also kind of exercise my decision making skills 

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,840
with, you know, a new business. And then after 3 years I was promoted

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,480
to the manager of SOCC and I've been in my most recent role for 3 years.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,960
A little bit of luck, a little of bit hard work and I've been fortunate

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,960
to move up quite quickly.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Iris: That's great, sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So you manage a team, I'm curious, how big is the team and 

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
what qualities do you look for when hiring?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Allison: I have a team of about 55 in various positions. All different 

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,440
types of qualifications but if I were kind of to put everything 

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,440
into one bucket- to kind of come into the operations centre.

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,440
you certainly need to have some sort of basic aviation background 

34
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,320
And the learning curve is quite sharp even once you're in the op centre.

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,320
But you do need to have a you know a good comprehension 

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
of technology, you push a lot of buttons in SOCC- pun intended,

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:14,520
and you know, you need to be able to multi-task, make decisions

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
and you have a really high self standard and pride in the work 

39
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,520
that you're delivering.

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,520
And you need to care- not only about the people within the business,

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,520
but also our passengers.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,600
Iris: What would you say are some of 

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,080
the challenges that you faced in your career?

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Allison: You know, I would get to those junctures in my career,

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,080
when opportunities would come up and you really have to decide 

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,080
what you have to take...

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,080
And I would feel extremely isolated and really not know who 

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,080
to turn to for support in my immediate community and family.

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,040
I didn't really have anybody that had been in aviation 

50
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,720
or business the way that I am so, I think that's why mentorship 

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,720
is just so important. It can be so difficult to maneuver through

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,720
those crossroads and you know, it would have been nice to 

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,720
maybe have a little bit of guidance and helping hand. 

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Iris: What would you say is the coolest thing you got to do in your role?

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Allison: Oh, my job is so cool! 

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,720
I get to do puzzles all day long, so I even have one that 

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,720
looks like Tetris, if you're old enough to get that reference...

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,720
But I also joke with my colleagues you know, we push up our glasses 

59
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,720
because you know we're like "oh... What's ATC doing?"

60
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
and "What's happening with that runaway closer in Montreal?"

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,720
and "What altitude is the tropopause at?" You know

62
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,120
But seriously though, we get to problem solve all day.

63
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,120
You always get to figure out new ways to do things, because no two

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,280
situations are the same. And you really get to navigate new territory

65
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,200
all the time and it's so rewarding. You make decisions and things

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,200
turn out and it's very, very rewarding.

67
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Iris: If you could ask your role model in the industry one thing,

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
what would you ask them?

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Allison: I think to kind of take this into two veins,

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
it would be you probably around mentorship a little bit, you know.

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Is there anything that I'm missing? What are my blind spots? 

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
You know, what don't I know that I wish I knew?

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
And then it's kind of on the failure side.

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,160
Because you know, we all fall down from time so I would want to know 

75
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
you know, "Did you ever trip? What caught you off guard and

76
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,160
how did you get back up again?"

77
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Iris: Those are great questions! And if you could share one piece

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,160
of advice on building success, what would that be?

79
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,200
Allison: Again I'm sorry, I have two but I promise to make it quick!

80
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
I would say the importance of diverse experiences.

81
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,200
There is no one path forward, and just get out there and try everything.

82
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,240
But you know, the aviation industry can be a little bit intimidating 

83
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,240
and you know, don't be scared about the things you don't know,

84
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,240
you just simply don't know them yet.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Iris: That is great advice, I'm going to take that advice.

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,600
Thank you so much for joining us today, it was really great getting 

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
to understand a bit more about what you do with Porter Airlines!
:)

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
Allison: Thanks so much.
:)
