00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,960
Hi Joelle, thanks for being with us today 

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,480
so we can learn a bit more about what you do.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,320
Could you tell us a little bit about what a flight surgeon does?

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,400
Joelle: A Flight Surgeon is a type of medical officer 

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,640
and a medical officer is a physician in the military. 

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,200
Flight Surgeons practices a specific subset of medicine which is aviation medicine.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,200
A lot of people, when they initially hear "Flight Surgeon",

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
They think we're up in a plane doing surgery which honestly,

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,920
I think would be pretty cool but that's not what we do.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,480
We maintain the like really strict medical standards 

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,480
for air crews so they're able to do their jobs.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,400
We're also responsible for flight safety investigations,
Aero medical evacuations - 

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,360
if someone gets sick how to get them home, 

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,320
and we provide an advisory role for operations

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,280
in between all that, we're also acting as like

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,200
a normal family doctor treating patients and air crew

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,160
but those are all the additional skills that we have

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,120
that we get training for to be able to work as a Flight Surgeon.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,840
Iris: I was probably one of those people who thought that
 you were doing surgery in the air so... ha ha ha

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,800
Joelle: Honestly I didn't know it existed either

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,760
until middle of medical school and when I found out I was like "I would love to do that!"

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,720
Iris: What made you the best candidate for the role?

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,400
Joelle: I think that my background really provides a strong knowledge base.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,720
So I have a Bachelor of Science in Astrophysics, 

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,240
A Master of Science in Quantum Physics, 

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,520
and I am a private pilot and all of those things

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,760
together provide a different perspective into

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,480
providing medical care for air crew.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,240
So being a pilot myself I understand what it's like to go see, 

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,000
whether it's your civilian medical provider or renew your air crew, like you are worried about going.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,760
You don't want them to say that you can't fly and I understand that worry and I think

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,520
that gives me an opportunity to interact with air crew differently

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,400
and hopefully take down some of the barriers that exist 

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,160
between the flight surgeon and air crew.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,080
I'm not super vocal about being a pilot but some people know

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,880
and I think that can bridge the gap.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,640
Iris: I bet you're able to really alleviate some of the stresses

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,400
for the pilots and everything with your perspective so that's great.

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,960
What are some of the challenges you've faced in this role?

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Joelle: A lot of people join the military to do roles that

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,720
they couldn't otherwise do in the civilian world. For me, that's being a flight surgeon and doing


42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,560
all the interesting things whether that's flying in the jets,

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,320
Or deploying, or going on exercises, aeromedical evacuation-

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,080
but because of the pandemic a lot of those things have been canceled this year 

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,840
and so that's been a struggle to accept that this is a different

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,600
time and I am getting a different experience for better or worse and accepting 

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,240
  that this is this year's journey.

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Iris: "This year's journey" is going to be the sort of the caption for this year

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,640
Joelle: Yeah haha

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,000
Iris: Different for everyone haha so...

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,760
If you could ask your role model anything what would it be?

52
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,440
Joelle: I honestly think that I would ask them to hang out at a bon fire

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,200
Or go for a walk and just get them to tell me stories 

54
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,960
because you can learn a lot about a person and how 

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,720
they got to where they are just from hanging out.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,080
I love hearing stories and I love getting to know people one on one that way and that's what I would request.

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,840
Iris: A woman after our own hearts! We are a big fan of stories and we

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,320
totally appreciate the idea of how much you learn from those stories!

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,080
So what you say is one of the coolest things you've gotten to do in your role?

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,840
Joelle: Fly in the F-18 Hornet for sure ha ha.

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,800
Yeah, the most powerful aircraft I've ever been in and probably will ever be in

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,360
and yeah... Whole new perspective. 

63
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,120
I very much respect what those pilots do on a day to day basis.

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,880
Iris: Yeah I can see why that's trumping your list of coolest things ha ha!

65
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Not that many people in this world who are able to say 

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,880
"Yeah I flew in an F-18, no big deal" 

67
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,880
Joelle: Mmmhmm! 
Iris: Very cool!

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,880
If you could share one piece of advice on building professional success,

69
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,440
What  would it be?

70
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,560
Joelle: You have to first define what that means to you

71
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,160
not based on what other people think professional success is,

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
and then from there once you have your goal, try to make a path or plan

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
on how to get there because a lot of the time, it's just those "every day" actions

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,640
that will lead to the end result, not like the final push.

75
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:07,240
Being able to get up every day and work towards it, is the most important thing to accomplishing those goals.

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Iris: Defining things for yourself is so important because you can't look

77
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,240
at other people and think "okay that's the steps that I need to take"

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,720
It's so unique to you and it so important to define your own success and 

79
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,640
not what success looks like to the outside world.

80
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,800
So I think that's really great advice.

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,320
Thank you so much for being here, Joelle!

82
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,840
it was so lovely chatting with you and getting to know what the heck a "Flight Surgeon" does!

83
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,880
That's awesome!
:)

84
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,200
Joelle: Thanks for having me!
:)
